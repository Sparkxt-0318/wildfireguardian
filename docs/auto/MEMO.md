# Loop memo — lessons that change the next lap (re0-memo)

Append-only. One entry per lap that learned something; a lap that learned nothing
writes nothing. Format: date · lap kind · lesson (as a gate or anti-pattern, not a
mood) · evidence.

- 2026-09-03 · kickoff · **Pinned requirements install from PyPI wheels alone**
  (Python 3.11, macOS arm64 27 s; Linux verified in Session 18). The conda note in
  `requirements.txt` predates that measurement; `scripts/auto/bootstrap.sh` uses
  pip and records `pins_ok`. Evidence: `.auto/bootstrap.json` on the first lap.
- 2026-09-03 · kickoff · **The gate that matters is the one a stranger runs.**
  Sessions 18–22 were green on one laptop and never pushed; `auto-gates.yml` now
  re-runs every gate on a clean Linux checkout for every push to `auto/**`.
- 2026-09-03 · dev · **A directory is not a proxy for the files a test needs.**
  `data/cache/osm/yeongdeok_2025/` is TRACKED — it holds `vegetation.geojson` —
  while the four graphs inside it are git-ignored. So `if not d.exists(): skip`
  never fired in a clean clone and two tests failed instead of skipping. Gate on
  the files the test actually opens, and skip only when they are ALL absent, so a
  partially-populated cache still fails loudly. Evidence:
  `tests/test_osm_cache_isolation.py`, and this lap's `.auto/gates.json`.
- 2026-09-03 · dev · **An absent input should skip, never error.** Seven
  `test_photo_exif` tests reported as ERRORS because the module-scoped `client`
  fixture built a runner that opens a git-ignored DEM. An unguarded fixture turns
  one missing file into a suite that looks broken, which is indistinguishable
  from a real regression at a glance. Guard the fixture, not each test.
- 2026-09-03 · kickoff (human-run lap) · **A gate's exit code must be the thing
  the push depends on, even in an ad-hoc shell.** The kickoff session ran
  `gates.py --mode quick | tail -2 && git push`: the pipe returned tail's zero,
  the gate was RED (one collision-check hit in the new JUDGE_QA.md), and the
  push went through; fixed within minutes, but it is the Session 10 mistake
  again, made by the same tooling this repository was built to stop.
  `check_gate_invocations.py` cannot see a command typed into a session.
  Gate: capture `gates.py` into a file, read `$?`, and push only on 0; never
  pipe it. Evidence: commits `14f6870` (red) and `953eb6c` (fix).
