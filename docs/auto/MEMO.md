# Loop memo — lessons that change the next lap (re0-memo)

Append-only. One entry per lap that learned something; a lap that learned nothing
writes nothing. Format: date · lap kind · lesson (as a gate or anti-pattern, not a
mood) · evidence.

- 2026-09-03 · kickoff · **Pinned requirements install from PyPI wheels alone**
  (Python 3.11, macOS arm64 27 s; Linux verified in Session 18). The conda note in
  `requirements.txt` predates that measurement; `scripts/auto/bootstrap.sh` uses
  pip and records `pins_ok`. Evidence: `.auto/bootstrap.json` on the first lap.
- 2026-09-03 · kickoff · **The gate that matters is the one a stranger runs.**
  Sessions 18–22 were green on one laptop and never pushed; `auto-gates.yml` now
  re-runs every gate on a clean Linux checkout for every push to `auto/**`.
- 2026-09-03 · dev · **A directory is not a proxy for the files a test needs.**
  `data/cache/osm/yeongdeok_2025/` is TRACKED — it holds `vegetation.geojson` —
  while the four graphs inside it are git-ignored. So `if not d.exists(): skip`
  never fired in a clean clone and two tests failed instead of skipping. Gate on
  the files the test actually opens, and skip only when they are ALL absent, so a
  partially-populated cache still fails loudly. Evidence:
  `tests/test_osm_cache_isolation.py`, and this lap's `.auto/gates.json`.
- 2026-09-03 · dev · **An absent input should skip, never error.** Seven
  `test_photo_exif` tests reported as ERRORS because the module-scoped `client`
  fixture built a runner that opens a git-ignored DEM. An unguarded fixture turns
  one missing file into a suite that looks broken, which is indistinguishable
  from a real regression at a glance. Guard the fixture, not each test.
